
Interface is something which is common in two systems. It is
    like a contract that helps us know what type of methods
    should be present in a class for that class to be able to work
    with other classes.

Asghar's concept-
        interface is like a contract; its about what type
        of method a class must have to interact with other clases (must have common Methods)
        only then

Meaning of interFace in realLife -
        the point when two things meet
