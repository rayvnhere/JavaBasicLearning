Abstraction -
abstract means smth which isn't clear or not complete

the abstract word means smth which isnt clear or incomplete.
so we use abstraction to create methods which are incomplete meaning
they dont have a body, they only have method headers.

used when someone doesn't know what to do

Abstraction -
1) either we don't know how this method will be implemented so we dont want to
write the code and leave it for other then we create abstract methods

Abstract Method - doesn't has body means no block of code
they only have Method Header meaning they would only have a

1) returnType
2) access modifier
3) nameOfMethod
4) Parameters

Q: why they wont have Code in body?

A: if im architect - just want to define for others to write
     or i don't know how to write this code and others will do it

to achieve PolyMo;
must inheritance
must methodOverridden
