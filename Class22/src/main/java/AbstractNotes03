pros of abstract > can create method without body
cons of abstract > cant create object of abstract class

Q: Can we have instance Fields inside abstract class?
A: yes, can have private/public/protected instance fields

*can have static fields/ static methods as well

Q: if there are instaFields should we also have a CoN
   to initialize those fields?
A: we cant create object of class, so there's no point of creating
   CoN inside abstractClass, BUT we can use them in childClasses with
   the help of super keyword

* purpose of CoN is to help create object
