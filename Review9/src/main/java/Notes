PolyMorphism  -Polymorphism taken from two word poly(multi)and phism(form )
               mean multiple forms

              -its a mechanism in java that allos us to
               the methods to behave differently depending upon
               which object we are using to call them.
There are two types of poloymorphism; dynamic and Static
Dynamic PolyM- is achieved throguh method overrriding
Static PolyM -is achieved through method oerLOading

When should we use PolyM/benefits?
A: it allows us to avoid code repetition
if we have to call multiple methods from multiple class and they are
all siblings classes

what it does > same method will do different things
depending on which object you use to call it

What do we need to apply PolyM?
we need the following things;
1) there should be inheritance(common parent and child)
2) method overriding
3) type Casting (e.g Animal animal= new Dog();  )
4) loops
5) arrays

whats the purpose of CoN?
con is a block of code thetas helps to initize the instance Var of a class


there are two types of Typecasting and there is two ways of writing it
idk lol watch from after break
((Dog)a).run();         ?
Dog d2=(Dog)a;          ?


*use polyM for webdrivers
*con do not EVEr need REturnType
*to achieve poly @override is a must without override we cannt use it object class

muhhayo's notes below
Interface:
Interfaces are like contracts which make sure that everybody is on the same page.
They achieve this through abstraction.
1.Inside the interface, all the methods are abstract and public.
By default, all the variables we create inside the Interface are public-> static->final.
  Interfaces themselves are also abstract and public by default.
2.Inside interface, you cannot have instance variables. If there is no instance field, there is no need for
  constructors or objects of Interface.
The main of interface is everybody is following the same rules and everybody is on the same page.
