Collection FrameWork:-
    Collections framework is simply a collection of classes and interfaces.
    which help us store the data easily. The classes in this framework are
    dynamic and have a lot of built-in methods that we can use to manipulate
    the data.

    * dynamic means they can change, grow or shrink
    * Problem's of array 1) they are fixed, whether you use them or not they will occupy the space
                        2) they aren't classes so they don't have built in methods like delete,remove or etc
                        while ArrayList is a class, so it has methods, built in methods.

In Collection of FrameWork, there are 3 main categories of classes
3 Main Interfaces
1)List 2) Set 3) Map
__________________________________________________1____________________________________________________
    List:
    1) List can store duplicate numbers.
    2) The remember the order in which you insert the data.
    There are two main classes which implement the list interface
    ArrayList and LinkedList.
    ArrayList internally USES an array. Which makes accessing the elements
    Fast but adding or removing the elements is super slow in arrayList.
    On the other hand LinkedList uses a double linkedList internally.

*ArrayList :- they store data in a straight/ consecutive memory location and because
of that, they can access the elements very fast BUT adding and removing the data from ArrayList is slow

*LinkedList :- they store the data in a non-consecutive memory location i.e. RANDOM (here and there)
so accessing them is SLOW but adding and removing is very FAST.

Sets:
    Sets don't allow duplicate elements.
    There are three main types of sets.
    1)HashSet 2) LinkedHashSet 3) TreeSet.
1)HashSet:
    Pros:
        Hashset is Fast.
    Cons:
        They don't remember the order in which we insert the elements (random set)
2) LinkedHashSet:
    Pros:
        They remember the order (original set)
    Cons:
        A little slow as compared to Hashset.
3) TreeSet:
    Pros:
        They always keep the data sorted (ascending way), fastest in searching data
    Cons:
    The insertion is very slow, cuz its all organized, and if new things add-up it has to decide where to add it and in re-organize it again

*difference between 'lists' and 'sets'
ans= 'lists' allow duplicate elements and 'sets' don't, same is the case with their types.
* there's no indexing in 'Sets' thats why there's no getMethod, but can use enchancedForloop to get all


*in interview, say 'lists' 'sets' and 'maps' have more then 100 types but most famous and used are these 3 types.
__________________________________________________3_____________________________________________________
Maps:
    Maps Allow us to store the data in pairs(key,value) unlike 'Lists' and 'sets' who deals with one element at one time
    There are three Main types of Maps.
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
1)HashMap:
    Pros:
        Hashset is Fast.
    Cons:
        They don't remember the order in which we insert the elements.
2) LinkedHashMap:
    Pros:
        They remember the order.
    Cons:
        A little slow as compared to HashMap.
3) TreeMap:
    Pros:
        They always keep the data sorted.
    Cons:
    The insertion is very slow.

*'maps' dont use loops directly, they first need to be converted to 'entrySet' and then can have loop
*similarly 'Sets' dont support

File Handling:
    Dealing with files reading/writing/copying/moving files using programming.
    1) Location of the file /if we dont know the location we cant read or write the data
    2) Navigate to the location/means bring the file to the (RAM)into java memory
    3) A software/class that knows how to read/write data to that file.
//once we have all these 3 steps then we can start dealing with the file

 Configuration files:
    Configuration files are used to store sensitive configuration related information. Like URLS,
    usernames, passwords etc.
