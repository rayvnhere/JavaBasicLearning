*Compile means 'run' green triangle
Exception:
    An unwanted behaviour which disrupts the normal
    flow of your program.

There are three types of error;
1) Syntax Error/Static error/ CompileTime error
2) RunTime Error/Exceptions
3) Logical Errors
_______________________________________________________
Syntax Error/Static error/ CompileTime error:-
happens when we don't follow java's syntax/rules of code

SOLVED BY
They can be resolved by
1) error appears even before running the code
1) can get help from intellij
2) by learning the syntax
_______________________________________________________
Logical Errors:-
No compileTime error
No runtime error
e.g. ForLoop i>0

SOLVED BY
1) Looking by looking at the output(if came out as expected)
2) By debugging code

Console will give wrong answers
_______________________________________________________
RunTime Error/Exceptions:-
Code looks fine cuz no error occur during compileTime(means before running the code)
e.g. 10/0 (in console error)

SOLVED BY
try Catch Block

How to read Exception Errors/RunTime Error

1) Read from bottom
Shows from where the error is coming from  (location of error in project)
just click on the blue like and it will take you there

2) Look at info in console after colon : it defines the error and
before the : you can find that 'ErrorsLink' click and you will find error'sClass
cuz Error aren't error they are classes available in Java (they say, 'when can that error happen')
