here when someone again calls the readFile method, they will get the error
And they HAVE to write a try and catch block and if they also adds exception to method signature
like he did, then JVM (Java) will take care, cuz sometime when JVM reaches the end
it has a default handler and will might terminate the program ðŸ˜…
So it's better to handle it with 'try and catch block'

its like throwing responsibility to someone else, its like I cant write 'try and catch block' so ask someone else
