1st InterFace was List (arrayList and LinkedList) = allows duplicate and remembers order
2nd InterFace was Set (and its 3Types) = doesn't allow duplicate
3rd InterFace is Maps                  = helps store two section/things at a same time unlike 'list' and 'set' stores data one at a time(1 section)


SET is an interface and has its 3 types (that behave differently which is like polyMorphism)
1) HashSEt > fast but random order
2) LinkhashSet> slow and remembers the order
3) TreeSet   >  slow in inserting new element cuz always keeps data sorted ( retrieving/searching the element is awosome and quick)

Maps > has two sections > keys and values
map works great when there's pair

Maps:
     Maps allow us to store key value pairs.
     Keys are always unique but values can be duplicate
     There are three main classes which implement Map Interface;
     1) HashMap  2) LinkedHasMap 3) TreeMap

HashMap:       fast but doesnt rememebr the order in which I insert the items
LinkedHasMap:  slow and rememebrs the order
TreeMap:        keeps data sorted but insertion is slow


I think Map has 3 main operations;
1)  adding
2)  iterate (entrySet & Lambda)
3)  modify/delete/replace

* in python Maps are called dictionary
Maps are in real directory cuz they act ike dictionary
there's a key(word) and its meaning (value)





-----------------------------
2DArray's limitions;
1) fixed in size
2) dont have built in method
