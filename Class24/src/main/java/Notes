Collection of Framework;
has many classes;

1) ArrayList   (class)
2) LinkedList  (class)


Set: (is a class) (also helps with polyMorphism)
   sets are very similar to list but they do not allow duplicate elements

   they have special properties see E3Sets

Three Types of sets;
1) HashSet         has SET interface doesn't allow duplicate
2) LinkedHashSet   has SET interface doesn't allow duplicate
3) TreeSet         has SET interface doesn't allow duplicate

       HashSet: e.g. not organized (men wears anything)
Upside > they are FAST
Downside> dont store the data in order

       LinkedHashSet: e.g. organized (women needs matching shoes & accessories)
Upside > it remembers the order (called insertion order)
Downside> its slower then HashSet

       TreeSet:
Upside > keeps the data arranged/sorted always, nums and letters will be sorted like 1234
DownSide> inserting new element is very slow cuz of sort


there's no getMethod in SET but can use enchancedFor
cant use while or for loop, cuz no respect for index



The common thing between SET and LIST is > 'Collection Interface' see slides for graph
'Collection' is an interface
and because 'Collection' is the grandparent of SET and LIST, thats why they are convertable meaning
arrayList can be coverted to linkedList, linkedList can be converted to treeSet and treeSet to hashSet
any collection's class can be converted to any other collection class see E8Collections
