/*Object Oriented Programming(OOPs):
    OOPs is just a style of programming. Just a way of
    writing code that helps us write large amounts
    of code easily. It helps us manage and change large
    amounts of code. There are other ways as well
    as functional programming and procedural programming.
Pillars of OOPs:
    There are four main pillars of OOPs.
0)	Classes and Objects (by Sr. Asghar)
(they have multiple classes, but I should know each class)
    1) Inheritance
    2) Polymorphism
    3) Abstraction
    4) Encapsulation
Classes and Objects:
Making classes helps others to use our code, to shareable with others, for their object. Like how I use Scanner Class.
  (Class is the design for the Code) A class is a template/design/map/idea/blueprint
    from which objects are created.

Class has attributes and behaviors.





String is non primitive data type.String.
 */

Every class in java can act as datatype, and all of these datatypes are known as
non primitive datatypes.

Class is also a datatype, and so DOG is a datatype.

        /*
        Dog => Data type
        dog1=> is a variable that holds the object
        new Dog();=> Creating the object of Dog class
         */

/*How we can share our Classes with other?
ans= can share in the form's of Jars, in the form of Module's, push it to the
GitHub etc.
