/*Methods in Java:
    Methods/Function/Behaviours are blocks
    of code. They contain statement(lines of code) which
    are executed when a method is called.
In Java methods requires to be inside Class, this isnt the case for C++ or Python their methods
can be be executes without creating class.

A method in java has a return type(output) name and parameters/arguments(inputs).

Why should we use methods?
    Methods help us reuse the code. When we need to share/reuse a
    piece of code within our project or with others we can
    create our own classes define methods inside those classes
    and we can start reusing/sharing them.

Syntax of the method:
    returnType(output) nameOfTheMethod (input/parameters){
    return means(when you call a method, what is it going to GIVE YOU BACK in a DATATYPE,
     we need to tell Java in Class how we want the method to be returned e.g
    (length returns integar)(startsWith || endsWith returns BOOLEAN)
    (concat || replace returns STRING)

    //indexOfMethod returns an integar (return means output)

    nameOfTheMethod (input/parameters) is used to refer to call the method e.g.
    concat input was string another e.g
    indexOf(nameOfTheMethod) 'J'(input)
    //indexOfMethod takes the character of J as an input (takes means took an input)

        int index= str.indexOf('J')
int index//returnType,output=str.indexOf//nameOfTheMethod ('J')//J is parameter,argument,input
  //if hover our mouse on index it will pop up to show returnType look at  // public int indexOf{ \\
int is the returntype
