/*
Access Modifiers:
      Access modifiers in java help us the control who can access what. There are 4 access
      levels and we use three keywords to control these levels. private, default, protected and public.

          String accountNumber="1234456";
        //above line is a field

PRIVATE Variables & Method:
    Is the most restricted one when used with a variable or method
    those can't be accessed OUTSIDE of THAT class/package, where he was created
Can only be accessed within the class it was created in.

DEFAULT fields & Methods
       Also restricted but little flexible then private.
       if you dont write any keyword then those r becomes default
Can be accessed in any class AS LONG AS its in the same PACKAGE

PUBLIC Class, Fields & Methods;
     accessable for any class, any package even FOR THE ENTIRE Project

How to know when to use Private?

Why we use methods?
to reuse the code again and again.

Asghar said;
> Always try to create your methods as PUBLIC
> your fields as PRIVATE


Important note:
    1) 99% of the METHODS are public.
    2) 99% of the INSTANCE FIELDS are created as private.
    3) 99% of STATIC FIELDS are public.
    4) 99% of the time CLASS are also public

//Final keyword can be understood when I know inheritance pillar of OOP's
