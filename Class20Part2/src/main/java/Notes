Assigning a value of one type to a variable of another type is known as Type Casting.
2 two types of casting in Java:
• Widening Casting (Implicit/ Automatic)   /UpCasting
        - converting lower data type into higher.
• Narrowing Casting(Explicit/ Manual)     /DownCasting
        -converting higher data type into lower.


Upcasting: Casting from a subclass to a superclass is called upcasting
Downcasting: It's the casting from a superclass
to a subclass.
