/*Super Keyword:
    Super keyword is used  to access     fields/methods/constructor
    from the parentClass when there is an inheritance relationship
    between the classes.

'Super' is like 'this'

Q: What is 'this' keyword?
A: Whenever there's same name localVar and same name InstaVar,
then 'this' keyword is used to refer to InstaVAr

USES of 'this' keyword;
1)this keyword FOCUS on InstanceVar

2) 'this' we can reuse constructor's or call other constructors
from the same class inside another consturctor that is also in the same class.

Q: What does a constructor do?
A: helps us to build an object from class by initializing privating instaVar and then assigning their values.

Q: Why matching Con's for ParentClass and ChildClass?
A: Because of the Inheritance they are connected...if not matching then both parent and child
will be printed. see ParentlearningClass

Q:In how many ways we can use super keyword?
A: 1) whenever there will be same name field in ParentClass and ChildClass,and to Call a field/method
   from the ParentClass.
   2) use super(with TheseParenthesis) when ParentClass has a CON, then the ChildClass should also have a
   matching CON, only then we can call ParentCon in ChildClass using super()

*Rule
     name of the public class "Dog" must match with the name fo the FILE(classname under Main)
     "Dog" and then you can create multiple classes.

* Java creates defualt CON automatically on its own for us, when we dont create any CON
* Con helps to bring a class into ALIVE

* SUper keyword doesnt work with static
* Super can work with any CONstructor

MethodOverloading

this happens when multiple methods in a class coexist with same name but with different paremeters.
