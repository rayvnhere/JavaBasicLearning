Encapsulation - secured organized class
 1) for every entity - create a class for it and have the methods related to it inside that class
 2) make instance var PRIVATE
 3) create getterSetter method (for other classes to ready and modify)

Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation says create a class for every entity and define
    methods related to that entity in that class instead of putting
    everything inside the main method. It also says make your
    fields private and define getter setter methods for those
    fields.
------------------------------------
/*  short form of getter means to get

  why we need getter method?
  to expose the fields to other classes for READ only

  how getter is written/use?
  -use get keyword      and Same DataType as of Field
  -getter return data   and  nameofField   */
-------------------------------------
/*  why we need setter method?
  with setter method, i can read value of field and setter helps to modify the value of fields
  /*   how setter is written/use?
             -use set keyword
             -void nameofField
             -this(cuz same name of field and same name in setter's parameter        */
