InterFace
 They are contracts, they are used to make sure that every programmer
 is on same page?They use abstraction for this purpose.

But how do they make sure of that?

  Create interface that defines :-
  add interFace after public
  what kind of methods i want everyone to implement

  by default every method inside InterFace method is;
  1) public
  2) abstracts meaning no body/curly bracket of codes

  they only have;
  1) returnType
  2) nameOfmethod
  3) parameters

*can have multiple methods in interFace
*when classes not related to each other use abstraction
*interFaces cannot have instanceVAr
*interFaces are bigger dataTypes
*cannot override in interface, we can only override in classes


  go with interFace when classes have no related methods in them

how others will use the interFace Contract?
  1) use implements keyword
  2) provide body of ALL METHODS of interFace Contract
